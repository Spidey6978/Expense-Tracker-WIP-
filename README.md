# Expense Tracker (WIP - probably still buggy)
A project I decided to start to understand and implement Flutter. Isn't complete yet, but will be soon.
You can keep a record of transactions between contacts using this app by adding a contact and adding a specific amount that you owe them/ have to receive from them.
