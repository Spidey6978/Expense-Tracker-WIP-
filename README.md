# Expense Tracker (WIP - probably still buggy)
A project I decided to start to understand and implement Flutter. Isn't complete yet, but will be soon.
You can keep a record of transactions between contacts using this app by adding a contact and adding a specific amount that you owe them/ have to receive from them.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
